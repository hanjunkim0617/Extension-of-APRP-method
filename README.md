# Extension-of-APRP-method
Extension of Approximate Partial Radiative Perturbation (APRP) method

Field : climate science
Main purpose : Decomposition of radiative flux changes in GCMs (General Circulation Models)

Originally, APRP method is used to attribute the change in SW fluxes at TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) to the change in surface albedo, cloud properties, and non-cloud properties.
(Taylor et al. 2007 : https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/11/jcli4143.1.xml)
Here, I extend the original APRP method for TOA to the surface, by using the one-layer radiation model.
Note that the variations of one-layer radiation model is possible with variable "flag_model", "ar", "rr".
Refer to attached PDF and codes for the detailed explanation.

This version of extended APRP method is developed for the below research:
