# Extension-of-APRP-method
Extension of Approximate Partial Radiative Perturbation (APRP) method

Programming language : matlab

Field : climate science

Main purpose : Decomposition of radiative flux changes in GCMs (General Circulation Models)

Originally, APRP method is used to attribute the change in SW fluxes at TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) to the change in surface albedo, cloud properties, and non-cloud properties.
(Taylor et al. 2007 : https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/11/jcli4143.1.xml)

Here, I extend the original APRP method for TOA to the surface, by using the one-layer radiation model.

Note that the variations of one-layer radiation model are possible with function argument "flag_model", "ar", "rr".
Refer to Appendix A of below paper and attached PDF for the detailed explanation.
